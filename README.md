# Responsive Layouts Practice

## Imperfect Foods Comp Recreation

You will be recreating a piece of the old imperfect foods website. 

Your goal is to recreate that section of the site, matching the comps below, using HTML and CSS. We suggest that you begin by building out one layout (it doesn't matter which you choose), and then make it responsive to the other screen sizes. The goal here is to practice with responsive layouts, so don't get too caught up in the other details. For example, you can ignore the lighter teal brush strokes in the background. Fonts and colors are in the CSS file for you. The basic HTML content has been added for you. You can change any of the HTML as you see fit. 

## Here are some screenshots to help you:
